to run the test:-
- install Maven
- start the validation service, by running startApplication script
- run test run-tests script, which will trigger maven clean install then execute cucumber scenarios
- the final HTML(also other formats are available) test report will be saved in the target directory/output


kindly, let me know if you have any quesitons @Haitham Jassim

#Note
-- the code has been added to src java dir, because in future there will be a need to write unit test for the my test code then this will
be become handy
-- also, there a gradle build script ready, however due to time bandwidth the script will only build the packages by gradle build command. the gradle
cucumber test runner (gradle cucumber) is implemented but that is not 100% yet.
